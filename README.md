# Companion Source Code for C++ Concurrency in Action 2nd Edition

This repository contains the source code from the second edition of [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.cplusplusconcurrencyinaction.com/), by Anthony Williams.

The **listings** folder contains the listings from the book. Each file is named `listing_<chapter-number>.<listing-number>.cpp`, so `listing_1.1.cpp` is the first listing in chapter 1, which is marked as listing 1.1 in the book, and `listing_10.3.cpp` is the third listing in chapter 10, which is marked as listing 10.3 in the book.

* Here I have segregated the code of different chapters for easy linking with my notion notes.
* I have also added the CMakeLists.txt for them assuming all these to be executable which is not necessarily true but helps whereever it actually is an executable
* a .scpripts folder exist that contains nothing linked to code listings just some personal scripts used and thus can be ignored
* .appendix is useful and can be referrenced when necessary
